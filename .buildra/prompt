This is an Astro project with Tailwind CSS (via @astrojs/tailwind integration).

STYLING RULES:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for ALL styling
- Tailwind is auto-configured via the @astrojs/tailwind integration
- Do NOT use <style> blocks for layout/spacing — use Tailwind classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design (sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints)

IMPORTANT:
- Always run `npm install && npm run dev` to start
- Use .astro files for pages and components
- Never use `astro dev` directly — always use `npm run dev`
